# hangman
I'm making hangman in python for Hack Club Arcade

Comit 1:

"I plan to spend 5 hours today and tomorrow so I have enough tickets to buy a drawing tablet so I can help my friend animate his tv show.
Thank you Hack Club for the opportunity to support my friend and meet an amazing community of like minded people."

Yeah I kinda did it in two.

Open the game and feel free to play. 

I enjoyed learning new things!

Thanks Hack Club!
